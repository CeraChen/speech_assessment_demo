You are a senior college student. Liu Hong is a new student in your department. You are aware that Liu Hong has been under a lot of stress with study and is on treatment for depression. This morning Liu Hong asked you to have a read at one of her final essays and offer her some feedback. You read the essay and noticed it was badly written, with chunks of paragraphs plagiarised from other sources. Liu Hong told you she had to submit this paper tomorrow morning. You decide to send her a voice message to talk about her essay.
