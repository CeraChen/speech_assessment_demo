Liu Hong is a new student in your department who has been under a lot of stress with study and is on treatment for depression. Liu Hong asked you to read one of her final essays which will be submitted tomorrow morning and offer her some feedback. You noticed it was badly written, with chunks of paragraphs plagiarised. You decide to send her a message to talk about that.
Your message should show morality involving three key points: (1) The speaker’s manner of interaction is maximally cooperative, fully sustaining the endemic moral order of interaction; (2) The interaction clearly indexes universally preferred moral qualities in the speaker; (3) The speaker’s moral membership is fully established through the demonstration of moral conduct specific to the standards in their community.
