Liu Hong is a new student in your department who has been under a lot of stress with study and is on treatment for depression. Liu Hong asked you to read one of her final essays which will be submitted tomorrow morning and offer her some feedback. You noticed it was badly written, with chunks of paragraphs plagiarised. You decide to send her a message to talk about that.
Your message should show reasoning involving three key points: (1) Extremely efficacious, multi-angled and context-fitting remedies are provided to address interactional troubles at both the action and project levels; (2) The speaker provides exceedingly well-reasoned and contextually defensible accounts at both the action and project levels; (3) The entire occasion of interaction is exceptionally well organized at both the sequential and sequence levels, providing maximal progressivity and projectability.
