Liu Hong is a new student in your department who has been under a lot of stress with study and is on treatment for depression. Liu Hong asked you to read one of her final essays which will be submitted tomorrow morning and offer her some feedback. You noticed it was badly written, with chunks of paragraphs plagiarised. You decide to send her a message to talk about that.
Your message should show affiliation promotion involving three key points: (1) The speaker is maximally pro-social through successful launches of substantively affiliative actions; (2) A very high degree of empathetic understanding and sharing of frames is evoked, established, and maintained via the use of substantive forms of empathy display and frame identification; (3) The speaker is extremely keen and competent in pursuing, maintaining, and restoring intersubjectivity.
