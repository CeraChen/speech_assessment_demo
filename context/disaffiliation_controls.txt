Liu Hong is a new student in your department who has been under a lot of stress with study and is on treatment for depression. Liu Hong asked you to read one of her final essays which will be submitted tomorrow morning and offer her some feedback. You noticed it was badly written, with chunks of paragraphs plagiarised. You decide to send her a message to talk about that.
Your message should show disaffiliation controls involving two key points: (1) Disaffiliation is successfully and skillfully remediated, social solidarity unaffected. Disaffiliative actions are either unstated or approached exceedingly strategically in a way that does not cause affront; (2) Turn design conforms clearly with dispreferred formats, drawing on a wide range of lexical devices, morphosyntactic features and evidential markers.
