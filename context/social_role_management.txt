Liu Hong is a new student in your department who has been under a lot of stress with study and is on treatment for depression. Liu Hong asked you to read one of her final essays which will be submitted tomorrow morning and offer her some feedback. You noticed it was badly written, with chunks of paragraphs plagiarised. You decide to send her a message to talk about that.
Your message should show social role management involving three key points: (1) The speaker has outstanding competence in enacting and orienting to social roles that are highly congruent with their and the interlocutors’ categories, matching their conduct with their respective category-bound predicates and relative hierarchical positioning; (2) There is an excellent application of the standardized relational pairs, membership categorization devices and duplicative organizations to which the speaker and interlocutor belong; (3) Highly skilled mediation and prioritization of the speaker’s and the interlocutors’ roles are demonstrated.
